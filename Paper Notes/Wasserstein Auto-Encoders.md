## Summary
WAEs are using relaxed Optimal Transport (OT) objective, optimized with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) or adversarial training, to achieve latent space matching. This approach can be seen as a generalization of the Adversarial Auto-Encoder (AAE), offering a refined mechanism for aligning latent distributions with the prior.

## Bullet points
- MMD formula originates from kernel trick
	- ![[Pasted image 20240725121716.png]]
- perhaps better handles the cliff problem in reconstruction
- lack of information about the direction importance when encoding
